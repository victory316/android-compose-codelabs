/**
 *
 *  < Why using custom input state? >
 *
 *
 *   The logic to update the textState and determine whether what's been displayed corresponds to the hint or not is all in the body of the CraneEditableUserInput composable. This brings some downsides with it:

The value of the TextField is not hoisted and therefore cannot be controlled from outside, making testing harder.
The logic of this composable could become more complex and the internal state could be out of sync more easily.
 *
 * By creating a state holder responsible for the internal state of this composable, you can centralize all state changes in one place. With this, it's more difficult for the state to be out of sync, and the related logic is all grouped together in a single class. Furthermore, this state can be easily hoisted up and can be consumed from callers of this composable.

In this case, hoisting the state is a good idea since this is a low-level UI component that might be reused in other parts of the app. Therefore, the more flexible and controllable it is, the better.
